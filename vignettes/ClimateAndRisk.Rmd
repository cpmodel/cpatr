- Why Risk and Climate

The SECI Model

The SECI (Solar Energy Corporation of India) model is simple. Interpose a high rated counterparty between the offtaker and the project developer. That means that the project developer can borrow at a lower rate. This creates a higly rated stream of revenues that can 'back' sovereign-rated bonds.
