The cpatr R package is a simplified version of CPAT.
It currently features:

  - Harmonized input data in Matrix column format to simplify implementation.
  
  - The domestic prices algorithm.
  
  - The mitigation equation covering energy demand for non-power sectors.
  
  - Calculations for multiple countries and scenarios on a single run.
  
  - Policy mixes, although still limited to Carbon Taxes and a simplified version of ETS.
