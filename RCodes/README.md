RCodes.xlxs contains deprecated 'RCode' column along with other columns for context.
The copy was made from CPAT v376.

In 'Standard paste' sheet cells contain references to file named 'CPAT 1.0pre_376.xlsb' (it must be opened for it to read the values properly).

In 'Pasted as values' sheet it was pasted as values for cleaner view.
