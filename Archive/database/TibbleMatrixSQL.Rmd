```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### Background

CPAT data is programmed as tibble-matrix R object 

Example of a tibble matrix object we pre-loaded called data_input


```{r}
tbm <- readRDS("data_input.RDS")
```

The tibble-matrix above contains 15 columns if we check the colnames


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
